    <h1>Privacy Policy for Rhythm</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 23/04/2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Rhythm ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information in connection with your use of the Rhythm mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>

    <p>We want to be completely clear: <strong>Rhythm does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not ask for, collect, or store any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, location, contacts, photos, or any other sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All of the App's functionality and data processing occur solely on your device. No data is sent to our servers or any third party servers.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not use any analytics tools, tracking pixels, or other technologies to monitor your activity within the App or across other apps or websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. In-App Purchase (Pro Account)</h2>

    <p>The App offers a single in-app purchase for a "Pro Account." This purchase is processed entirely through the app store platform ([Apple App Store/Google Play Store - choose or list applicable stores]).</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect or have access to your payment information (such as credit card details) when you make this purchase. This information is handled securely and solely by the app store platform according to their own privacy policies and terms of service.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Management:</strong> We may receive information from the app store platform confirming that a purchase has been made so that we can unlock the "Pro Account" features for you within the App. This information is limited to the confirmation of the purchase and is not linked to any personal identifiers as we do not collect them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with any information, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>

    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
